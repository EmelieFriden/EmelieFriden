	<p>
		Once upon a time,  there lived at the North Pole a young reindeer named Rudolph.<br>He was a lively, happy reindeer and loved playing in the snow. But one day, the other <br>reindeer noticed that he had a very large, bright red nose, and they teased him about it without mercy.<br>

	<strong>Rudolph is sad and begins to cry. The Tiny Reindeer prance off, still laughing.</strong><br>

		Rudolph was sad because it was Christmas Eve and he was afraid that, because of his shiny nose,<br> he would never be chosen to pull Santa’s sleigh. He went to visit Santa and Elf, who were getting all <br>their presents ready. They were always kind to Rudolph and never mentioned his funny nose.<br>

		Rudolph cheers up and trots off to see Santa and Elf, who are busy with all their presents.<br> He helps them work. While they work, day turns to night.<br>

	<strong>At last, Santa boomed, “Elf, I must go now. Let’s load up the presents.”</strong><br>

		Santa and Elf pack up the sleigh, while Rudolph helps them. 
		When all was ready, Santa asked,<br> “Where are my eight reindeer? I need their strength to pull 
		my sleigh.”<br>

	<strong>The Tiny Reindeer prance onstage and proudly take their places in front of the sleigh.</strong><br> 

		Then Santa looked around him and noticed how foggy the night had become. He was worried that he would<br> not be able to see his way. Suddenly he spied Rudolph with his bright red nose, and he had a very bright idea!<br>

	<strong>They get ready to leave but Santa stops them in their tracks. Then everyone’s eyes turn to Rudolph,<br> standing alone at the side.</strong><br>

	“Rudolph,” he cried, “I want YOU—with your shiny nose— to light the way for my sleigh tonight!”<br>

	<strong>Santa points to Rudolph, and the Tiny Reindeer cheer him.</strong><br>

		The Tiny Reindeer made way for Rudolph. Now everybody loved him and said what a very special reindeer <br>he was. From then on, Rudolph was Santa’s first choice every Christmas Eve.<br>

	<strong>Santa and Rudolph wave goodbye and fly away over the rooftops of houses, with their sleigh full<br> of Christmas presents.</strong><br></p>
